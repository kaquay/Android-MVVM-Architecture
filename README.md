# Android-MVVM-Architecture

Android-MVVM-Architecture is my architecture to build my Android project. I am following Clean Code.

## Remain task (update more later)

- Use ImageLoader interface instead of specific 3rd(we may have GlideImageLoader, PicassoProvider...)
- Move ItemModel to use-case layer ?
- Build an api.
